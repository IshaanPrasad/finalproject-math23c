This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


```{r, echo=FALSE}

  clean <- read.csv("clean.csv")
## Histogram with Normal Distribution added
  # Display Histogram
  hist(clean$Income, breaks = "FD", probability = TRUE, col="light blue", xlab = "Income (USD)", main = "Histogram of Income Distribution")
  # To find the best fitting normal distribution, compute the mean and variance of the data
  mu <- mean(clean$Income)
  var <- var(clean$Income)
  sigma <- sd(clean$Income)     #estimates square root of the population variance
  curve(dnorm(x, mu, sigma), from = 0, to = 250000, add = TRUE, col = "red")

## Visualizng the Percentage of a Race in a Tract compared the Average Income of the Tract
We used scatterplots to visualize the percentage of a specific race in a tract with respect to the median income of the tract overall. In particular, we found that the slope for the Asian population was the most positive of all the scatterplots, reflecting broader trends amongst one of the fastest growing, highest-educated minority groups in the nation.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
clean <- read.csv("clean.csv")
if (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2"); library(ggplot2)
percentA <- clean$Asian / 100       # Asian
  percentB <- clean$Black / 100       # Black
  percentH <- clean$Hispanic / 100    # Hispanic
  percentN <- clean$Native / 100      # Native
  percentP <- clean$Pacific / 100     # Pacific
  percentW <- clean$White / 100       # White
  income <-  clean$Income
# ggplotting the data: fulfilling "Nicely labeled graphics using ggplot, with good use of color, line styles, etc., that tell a convincing story"

    percentA,      # Asian
